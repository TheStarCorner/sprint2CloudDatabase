# Overview

The point of this program is to add, modify, or delete a game from the Cloud Database. Like I stated, you can modify parts of a game such as changing
the score you gave it, and also changing the amount of hours you played the game in total. 

Ex: You played Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and you used to give it a 4 out of 10 and played it for five hours. You can change that score to either a 7 or 8 out of 10 and maybe you played fifteen hours, which you would add your previous playtime with your new playtime, which equals to twenty hours.

The purpose of this software is to understand how to use a cloud database, in this case, Firestore. Also, it is important to understand how to make it
function properly as well.

# Cloud Database

I am using Firestore for my cloud database. I have organized the video game database into categories including 
the name of the game, how many hours was played, if the game was finished or not, and what they scored on a scale from one to ten. 

# Development Environment

I used Python, Firestone, and JSON for the software development. 
Firestore has a connection with VS Code through the program itself.

# Future Work
* Try to put more effort in the assignment.
* Make it look more good-looking with the layout.
* Have a more organized schedule for the project with an outline.
